# orbs

just a react website with a bunch of orbs that you can move basically.

<img src="orbs/src/data/orbss.gif" height=500>

<br>

## things to fix:
- don't let the user drag them out of the original window size
- adjust z-index so that the latest orb moved is on top
- ~~orbs sometimes collide when dragged over each other~~ (added ternary to change z-index when orb is pressed)
